# Uptime-Monitoring-Script

## About

Just a small uptime monitoring script for my personal projects. Drag and drop it into a free hoster of your choice ([000webhost.com](https://www.000webhost.com), [lima-city.de](https://www.lima-city.de), ...), update the config constant with your own settings, call it every 1-X minutes with [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) and when an error occurs you get a notification on your smartphone with the help of [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh). That's it. ðŸš€
